## History & Context

I've been following Paul Graham's essays for years now,
but when [Founder Mode](https://paulgraham.com/foundermode.html) came out
I realized that I had somehow missed the notification.

It turns out that the [RSS feed](https://paulgraham.com/rss.html) originally created by Aaron Swartz (RIP) fell behind.

As one would, I obviously had to point out that something on the internet is broken.

After a week of no response, I obviously had to take matters into my own hands and fix it.

This is the story of `pgessays-rss`.

## Developing this

You can check out [prompt](./prompt.md) for the original prompt and full conversation I had with ChatGPT to develop this.

All in all, it took ~75 minutes from start to finish.
